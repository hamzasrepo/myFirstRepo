# My first repository

Git is the most popular version control. 
Every programmer or developer needs to learn Git and GitHub. 
It lets them and others work together on projects from anywhere.
In this file, I will add a few lines of text and get meaningful insight 
into GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. 

## Thank you freeCodeCamp.org

These lines are a tribute to the freeCodeCamp.org community 
for making insightful content to provide beginners and professionals 
with hands-on knowledge of coding, programming, and much more. 

## Git Branching

Here, I have switched to a feature branch to get an insight into how branching works and how changes in one branch are seen in that branch only.
